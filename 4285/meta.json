Because the data format is different than in MongoDB, migration requires a full dump-and-reload, and because the replication format is different, it can be hard to migrate a live production system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn TokuMX 1.0.3, we are introducing a tool to make this process easier. It replays a vanilla MongoDB replication oplog on TokuMX.  This makes the migration process much simpler, more seamless, and it can be done with next to no downtime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis asciicast is an executable presentation.
